## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Enhanced Convex Payment History Function** ✅

#### **File**: `ra1programv1/app/convex/payments.ts`
```typescript
export const getPaymentHistory = query({
  args: { paymentId: v.id("payments") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Enhanced data gathering
    const payment = await ctx.db.get(args.paymentId);
    const parent = payment.parentId ? await ctx.db.get(payment.parentId) : null;
    const paymentPlan = payment.paymentPlanId ? await ctx.db.get(payment.paymentPlanId) : null;
    const installments = await ctx.db.query("paymentInstallments")...

    // Comprehensive event tracking
    const history = [];
    
    // Payment creation, plan assignment, installment events, 
    // payment completion, overdue status changes
    
    return { 
      history: sortedHistory,
      summary: {
        totalEvents, totalAmount, amountPaid,
        installmentsPaid, totalInstallments, parentName, paymentPlan
